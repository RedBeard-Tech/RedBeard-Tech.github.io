## Data Science

These blogs are meant for entry level to intermediate Data scientists and curiously minded people. The blogs mainly showcase how AI can be and is used (by me) in real world settings. The blogs will also contain introductions to some of the latest libraries and frameworks used in machine learning as well as further study material. Enjoy!
