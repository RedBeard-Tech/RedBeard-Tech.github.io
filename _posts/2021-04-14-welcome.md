## Introduction

I wrote my master's degree in coorperation with NOFIMA, a leading research institute with offices in Norway. During this time I had the pleasure of working with my supervisor Ellen Mosleth, who at the time was writing the following [research paper] (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-82388-w). If you clicked on the link and read the authors you might have noticed that my name is listed as one of the co-authors :D. 

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `filename` is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. `.md` is the file extension for markdown files.

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a "*level 1 heading*" in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line `## File names` above.

## Basic formatting

You can use *italics*, **bold**, `code font text`, and create [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Here's a footnote [^1]. Here's a horizontal rule:
