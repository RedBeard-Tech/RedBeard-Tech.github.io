# About me

I have a master's degree in Data Science and have been working at InsightOne Nordics as a Data Scientist/Analyst for approximately a year. During my time at InsightOne I have realized that a large number of small to medium buisnesses lack an understanding of what AI can do for their buisnesses how they can apply it. In my posts, I plan to describe the projects that I have been a part of and how these projects can be used in different buisness areas.
